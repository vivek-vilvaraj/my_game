		 * asteroid to be what it should be. Namely, the pointer to the
		 * asteroid being deleted. A diagram deleting two asteroids in a row is
		 * very helpful to visualize this.
		 *
		 * Second: In some circumstances an asteroid may get on the list to be
		 * deleted twice. Say, if by chance two torps hit the asteroid
		 * simultaniously. If this occurs, then the first deletion will be
		 * fine, but of course the second deletion will fail. So to prevent
		 * this, I check the list for duplicates, and if I find one, set the
		 * duplicate to NULL so that I don't attempt to delete the asteroid
